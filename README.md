# AdoptMe!
#### For this challenge, you will be working on AdoptMe!, an app where you can purchase movie tickets from the theater.! You will use a local API and build out the frontend for our app, AdoptMe!, 3/04/2023
#### By **John Thairu Kamau**
## Description
When using the application, one must see the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the character data. Have a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films` element when the page loads. You can either use the character information from your first request or make a new request to this endpoint to get the character's details. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets available).
