# AdoptMe!
#### For this challenge, you will be working on AdoptMe!, an app where you can adopt dogs! You will use a local API and build out the frontend for our app, AdoptMe!, 3/04/2023
#### By **John Thairu Kamau**
## Description
When using the application, one must see the first pets's details, including its **name, breed, gender, image, and description** when the page loads. The number of available pets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of `pets_adopted` from the pet's `capacity`. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the character data.You can either use the character information from your first request or make a new request to this endpoint to get the character's details. After clicking the "adopt" button, I should see the number of available pets decreasing on the frontend. I should not be able to adopt a pet if the showing has none (if there are 0 pets available).
